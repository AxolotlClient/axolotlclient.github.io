    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>AxolotlClient was created due to my anger against blowing up Minecraft Clients like Lunar & Badlion, which
      (like you'd expect) are completely proprietary and locked-down. I wanted to give an example on how to do it better
      and
      started developing this in August 2021. In this form I created something what I had not seen anywhere before:
      A Free & Open-Source Minecraft Client which even allows you to add your own mods for maximal customizability.
      If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to say „hi“, feel free to join out discord with the link
      above.
